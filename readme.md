###Designing a Responsive Portfolio Site

####Instructor: Craig Campbell

Responsive web design is firmly embedded in a modern web design workflow and cannot and should not be ignored. There are two approaches to incorporating responsive design into your workflow; desktop-first and then make it responsive for mobile devices, or mobile-first and leave the desktop until last. Whatever is your preferred way, we generally start from a mockup. In this course you'll learn how to design two different breakpoints for a responsive portfolio website using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
